\section{Interim Results}
% If possible, provide examples of any interim results you have achieved.
\begin{itemize}
\item Already play with existing case-studies in Rodin.
\item Install Rodin plugins, generate Java code from Event-B models.
\item Read the Event-B book \cite{eventb}.
\item Read Victor Rivera thesis (almost same theme).
\item Prepare materials I will need in work (Rodin handbook, Event-B
  documentations, Eiffel documentations also collect Nestor Catano and Victor
  Rivera papers)
\end{itemize}
