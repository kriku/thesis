\section{Review of Tasks}

% Provide a comprehensive review of the status of each task and sub-task, setting out at
% least:
  % The status (not started, on-going, complete, behind schedule, ahead of
  % schedule ...); 
  % Problems encountered and identified solutions;
  % Anticipated problems and possible solutions;
  % Impact on the project schedule.

By now I slightly behind the schedule. Right now I think about case-study model
in Event-B and couldn't say that fully get ideas of the book.

As case-study I suggested modeling translator itself. It is interesting idea but
could be difficult and useless. As a plan 
 -- use existing translator to Java (EventB2Java) to get Java code and
tweak it to Rodin plugin. But Victor Rivera think it could be difficult for me,
and actually doing work twice. So right now I should decide whether I will model
translator itself (this will prove it soundness) or I will implement translation
rules in Java as plugin to Rodin, and then prove soundness of the translator.

So schedule depends on my decision and if I choose first way -- I do not have to
prove soundness (save about a month I think), but in any case I have to
implement ``the Visitor''.

All other task going right on schedule.
